## Coding Interview Practice

This table of contents will serve as a tracker of what I have completed so far.

>Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. 
>We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, 
>but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. 
>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. - Aristotle

A list of all the questions I've practiced so far may be seen here. The time complexity, languages employed, and basic idea behind the solution are all included.

| Question Name | Difficulty | Time Complexity | Language | Main Idea |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Two Sum| Easy | `O(n)` | Python | Use a hash table to store and compare values of an array. This leads to faster time complexity than using a double for loop.
